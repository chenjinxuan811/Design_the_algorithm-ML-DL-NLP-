# Design_the_algorithm_ML_DL_NLP
This repository stores the code designed to realize some algorithms of machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing
The files are mainly divided according to the type of problem being dealt with
When a DL method is implemented to solve NLP problem, it will be in NLP instead of DL

# Machine Learning
In this part we design the algorithm of multiple linear regression, KNN, logistic regression, Kmeans, DBscan and neural network

# Deep Learning

# Natural Language Processing
